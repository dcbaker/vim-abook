# Abook-vim

Integration for abook in vim.

This adds a couple of basic commands for querying abook for email addresses in vim. This is a pretty rough start, but it gets the job done. Pull requests to enhance this script are welcome.

# TODO

- Documentation
- Support for --add-email (or maybe --add-email-quiet)
- Add autoload support to only work with proper extensions
